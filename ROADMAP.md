# fishy Roadmap

MVP = all six analysis methods + adaptive fusion + working CLI.

## Milestone 1 — Analysis Primitives ✅
> The math everything else depends on.

- [x] `shannon_entropy`
- [x] `ds_combine`, `ds_combine_many`, `ds_conflict`
- [x] `evidence_bpa`

## Milestone 2 — First Method + Working CLI ✅
> One complete path from disk to verdict. Validates the architecture end-to-end.

- [x] Define on-disk input format (one JSON file per source: `<source_id>.json`)
- [x] `distributional_divergence` (JSD)
- [x] `detect()` — distributional-only path: temporal validation → extraction → JSD → `evidence_bpa` → score → verdict
- [x] CLI: load collections from directory, call `detect()`, print output

After this milestone: `fishy -b baseline/ -c test/` works.

## Milestone 3 — Remaining Analysis Methods ✅
> Fill in the other four lenses. Each is independent.

- [x] `mutual_information_matrix` + `mi_matrix_divergence`
- [x] `spectral_fingerprint` + `spectral_divergence` + `spectral_entropy`
- [x] `wavelet_decompose`
- [x] `co_occurrence_spectrum` + eigenvalue computation
- [x] `matrix_entropy`

## Milestone 4 — Adaptive Fusion ✅
> The core contribution.

- [x] Baseline sub-sampling for stability estimation (multi-split: quarter splits → 3 complementary pairs)
- [x] Baseline entropy per method → applicability gate (normalized entropy thresholds)
- [x] Entropy delta (ΔH) as first-class observable per method
- [x] Z-score BPA construction: z = (observation - μ) / σ → `bpa_from_zscore` (positive z only → anomalous evidence)
- [x] Dempster-Shafer combination as primary scoring: score = m({anomalous}), uncertainty = m(Θ)
- [x] Wire all six methods into `detect()` under `FusionStrategy::Adaptive`

After this milestone: fishy is the actual product.

## Milestone 5 — Polish ✅

- [x] `--verbose` per-source breakdown
- [x] `--json` full `AnomalyReport` output
- [x] Multi-origin mode (overlapping sources only)
- [x] Rayon parallelism behind `parallel` feature flag
- [x] Applicability guards (skip dependency shift if <2 sources, skip spectral/co-occurrence if <32 events)

## Milestone 6 — Encoder ✅
> Tokenise raw log files into fishy's on-disk format.

- [x] `Dictionary` — frequency-ranked template IDs (most frequent → `TemplateId(1)`, `TemplateId(0)` reserved for unknown)
- [x] `LogFormat` — `NginxAccess`, `Syslog`, `Json`, `Custom`, `Bgl`
- [x] Sticky timestamps — events inherit the last seen timestamp until a new one appears
- [x] `build-dict` CLI subcommand — two-pass frequency count → rank
- [x] `encode` CLI subcommand — writes `<source_id>.json` + `meta.json` per collection
- [x] BGL dataset support — label-based baseline/test split, per-rack sources

## Milestone 7 — Encoder Patch (AIT-LDSv2 Prerequisites) ✅
> Minimal encoder fixes required before real-world evaluation can run.

- [x] Apache Combined Log Format (`-f apache`) — standard Combined Log Format, distinct from nginx
- [x] Suricata JSON nested field paths (`alert.signature`, `timestamp`) — dotted path support in JSON mode
- [x] Multi-file source input — concatenate rotated log files (`auth.log`, `auth.log.1`, `auth.log.2`, …) into one source

## Milestone 8 — AIT-LDSv2 Evaluation ✅
> Run fishy against a real multi-source labeled dataset and validate scores.
> Dataset: AIT Log Data Set v2.0 (Landauer et al., IEEE TDSC 2022) — https://zenodo.org/record/5789064

- [x] Download AIT-LDSv2 scenario (russellmitchell, 7.1 GB zip, 14 GB unpacked)
- [x] Preprocessing script (`scripts/prep_ait.py`) — parse syslog, apache, suricata JSON, audit, openvpn, dnsmasq; day-level splits
- [x] Run comparison pairs (day-level windows, 50+ sources each):
  - day_1 vs day_2 (normal↔normal) → 0.14 ✅
  - day_2 vs day_3 (normal↔attack) → 1.00 ✅
  - day_1 vs day_3 (normal↔attack) → 1.00 ✅
- [x] Document results (`results/ait_russellmitchell.md`)

## Milestone 9 — Drain Encoder
> Replace format-specific regex parsers with a format-agnostic Drain parse tree.
> Consistency guarantee: tree built from baseline, serialised, reused for test collection.
> Motivation informed by M8 results — do after seeing real template quality issues.

- [ ] Drain parse tree — fixed depth (3–4), token similarity threshold ~0.5, digit-containing tokens route to wildcard
- [ ] `MaxChild` branching limit to prevent tree explosion
- [ ] Single code path replaces all `LogFormat` variants
- [ ] Serialise trained tree alongside dictionary (`drain.json` next to `dict.json`)
- [ ] `build-dict` updated to build Drain tree in first pass, dictionary in second
- [ ] `encode` updated to load and apply serialised Drain tree

## Milestone 10 — Score Calibration ✅
> Validate that the scores mean something beyond the AIT-LDSv2 evaluation.

- [x] Synthetic collection generator (`gen` binary) — 9 severity-graded scenarios (clean, dist mild/moderate/severe, spectral mild/severe, dep_break, conflict, multi_anomaly)
- [x] Per-method sigmoid midpoints — wavelet 3.0, spec 2.5, others 2.0 (reduces day_0 FP from 0.86→0.74)
- [x] `source_weights` wired into dist divergence (weighted mean when provided)
- [x] `FusionStrategy` single-method modes — DistributionalFingerprint, DependencyShift, SpectralFingerprint, EvidenceConflict each run only their target method through adaptive pipeline
